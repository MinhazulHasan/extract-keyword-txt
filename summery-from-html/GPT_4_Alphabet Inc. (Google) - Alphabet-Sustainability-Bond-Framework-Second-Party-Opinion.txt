The text file is a Second-Party Opinion (SPO) provided by Sustainalytics, evaluating Alphabet Inc.'s Sustainability Bond Framework. Sustainalytics concludes that the Framework is credible, impactful, and aligns with the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018. The Framework's eligible use of proceeds categories, which include Energy Efficiency, Clean Energy, Green Buildings, Clean Transportation, Circular Economy and Design, Affordable Housing, Commitment to Racial Equity, Support for Small Businesses, and COVID-19 Crisis Response, are consistent with recognized Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles.

Alphabet Inc. has established an internal committee to evaluate and select eligible projects, with final approval by the Google Sustainability Officer. The management of proceeds will be tracked by Alphabet's Finance department, and unallocated proceeds will be invested in liquid securities. Alphabet intends to report annually on the allocation of proceeds and the impact of the funded projects until full allocation is achieved.

The Framework supports positive environmental and social outcomes and contributes to several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainalytics also notes that Alphabet has adequate measures to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks associated with the projects funded by the bond proceeds. The SPO was completed on July 31, 2020, by Sustainalytics, which is independent from Alphabet Inc.
