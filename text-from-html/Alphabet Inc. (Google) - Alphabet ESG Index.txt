The ESG index below maps our most recent public disclosures available as of April 2022,  to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. We are on a continuous journey to advance our ESG initiatives and repoing, and will continue  to evaluate and enhance our ESG disclosures  as we make progress.Alphabet  ESG Index1ESG Index 2022

TCFD IndexOur Index builds on our longstanding practice of repoing our climate-related activities to the CDP and in our Environmental Repos. We have formally expressed our suppo for the TCFD repoing framework and its seven principles for climate disclosure. We believe that our voluntary disclosures  on climate-related maers are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD framework.Core ElementsGovernance: Disclose the organization’s governance around climate-related risks and oppounitiesStrategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and oppounities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and nancial planning where such information is materialRecommended DisclosuresDescribe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and oppounities Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and oppounities Describe the climate-related risks and oppounities the organization has identied  over the sho, medium, and long term.
