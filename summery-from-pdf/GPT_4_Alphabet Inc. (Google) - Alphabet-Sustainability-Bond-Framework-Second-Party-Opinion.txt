The Alphabet Sustainability Bond Framework, evaluated by Sustainalytics, is deemed credible and impactful, aligning with the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018. The framework's use of proceeds covers categories recognized by the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, aiming to create positive environmental and social impacts and support specific UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Alphabet Inc. has established an internal committee, including a Google Sustainability Officer, to select and approve eligible projects. The company will manage proceeds using internal tracking systems and invest in liquid securities until allocation. Alphabet plans to report annually on its website about the allocation of proceeds and impact metrics until full allocation, with third-party assurance on compliance.

The framework supports Alphabet's robust sustainability strategy, which includes significant renewable energy purchases, energy-efficient operations, waste reduction, affordable housing initiatives, racial equity commitments, and responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Sustainalytics believes Alphabet is well-positioned to manage environmental and social risks associated with the projects funded by the bond.

The bond will contribute to various SDGs, including affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, and reduced inequalities. Sustainalytics concludes that Alphabet is suitable for issuing sustainability bonds and that the framework aligns with market standards and principles.
